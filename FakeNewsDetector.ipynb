bloc reopens a bitter feud over hosting refugees prime minister paolo gentiloni of italy which has at times been overwhelmed with mass arrivals of african refugees and migrants will talk to the leaders of poland hungary the czech republic and slovakia in brussels before all eu leaders discuss migration over dinner the four eastern eu states have persistently refused to accept asylumseekers to ease the burden on italy and greece the other sea gateway to europe even at the height of arrivals in when more than a million people reached the bloc since then on italy germany and other wealthy destination countries have called for an obligatory system of moving some of those arriving to other eu states when immigration spikes they see it as a matter of european solidarity which also manifests itself in the generous handouts the richer west provides but the easterners flatly reject any mandatory quotas on accepting people from the mainlymuslim middle east and africa saying that risks compromising their security after a raft of islamist attacks in europe since late instead on thursday the four will offer gentiloni some million euros mln for eubacked projects rome has been leading in libya to prevent people from trekking north to europe but internally the eu has been unable to agree on relocation something one senior eu diplomat likened to fighting trench warfare that has badly undermined member states trust in each other right before the eu leaders summit in brussels this thursday and friday their chairman donald tusk reignited the dispute by coming out out strongly against divisive and ineffective obligatory quotas an eu scheme agreed for two years in despite opposition by slovakia hungary romania and the czech republic to relocate people has only seen some transfers from italy and greece in an unusually public row between the eu s brussels institutions the bloc s executive arm which has been a strong proponent of a mandatory and automated relocation lashed out at tusk the executive european commission s migration chief dimitris avramopoulos called tusk s intervention unacceptable and antieuropean the disagreement between tusk and the commission translates into divisions between member states casting doubt on whether they will be able to reach an agreement by their june target date another senior eu diplomat had only modest expectations of the leaders migration discussion on thursday evening meaning they were not expected to take any decisions but at best make a small step towards unlocking a future agreement\",\n

wednesday debated resurrecting the stalled yucca mountain spent nuclear fuel dump in nevada a project critics say is hindered by the lack of an easy transport route representative john shimkus an illinois republican has proposed draft legislation to restart the licensing of yucca mountain the government has already spent billions of dollars for initial construction of the project which has been pending since ronald reagan was president former president barack obama opposed yucca and stopped its licensing process in but president donald trumps proposed budget provides million to restart licensing and for development of interim nuclear waste sites until yucca can be completed more details about the trump administrations support of yucca could come when a broader budget is released in may currently spent nuclear fuel which can be deadly if left unshielded is stored at reactors across the country first in cooling ponds and then in thick casks the yucca site itself about miles km northwest of las vegas faces a cumbersome and costly licensing process that could take years to complete and questions from critics about how long spent fuel can remain without radiation leaking into an aquifer yucca supporters say there is little groundwater at the desert site and what is there is contained by barriers and does not flow to any river or drinking water supply an even trickier problem will be getting the spent fuel to yucca mountain safely by train and truck from nuclear reactors sites all across the country transportation is the achilles heel of the yucca mountain repository site said bob halstead the head of nevadas agency for nuclear projects one train route studied by the department of energy known as caliente has been at least partially blocked by obamas designation of a national monument called basin and range another route known as mina is opposed by the walker river tribe which withdrew permission in for the government to ship waste through its reservation many casino owners and gaming associations also oppose the transport of spent nuclear fuel near the city of las vegas saying publicity about the shipments could harm property values and tourism the federal nuclear regulatory commission has pointed out that nuclear waste has been transported safely in the country for more than years which yucca backers are quick to cite shimkus whose state of illinois has more reactors than any other says yucca is ideal because of its remoteness there are no nuclear power reactors in nevada and the states entire congressional delegation which includes members of both parties opposes yucca representative jacky rosen a nevada democrat said a major accident would harm human health cost hundreds of millions of dollars in cleanup costs and damage the las vegas economy do you honestly believe that shipping over truck casks of highlevel nuclear waste over a span of years wont result in at least one radiological accident rosen said at the hearing the bill contains a measure directing the energy secretary to consider routes avoiding las vegas but the provision is unenforceable under existing laws halstead said nevada governor brian sandoval a republican met with energy secretary rick perry in washington on wednesday sandoval said he reiterated his opposition to yucca and urged perry to explore a realistic safe alternative to the
